# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0]

### Changed

- The package is renamed from `ex_v_ex` to `linen`, and every module from
  `ExVEx.*` to `Linen.*`. The API is otherwise unchanged. Replace
  `{:ex_v_ex, ...}` with `{:linen, "~> 0.3"}` in `mix.exs` and `ExVEx` with
  `Linen` in calling code.

## [0.2.1]

### Added — Excel tables

- `ExVEx.add_table/4` creates a table over a range: the header cells
  supply the column names (or pass `:columns`), with `:name`, `:style`,
  banding flags, and `:header_row` options. Validates the name, the
  minimum size, and overlap with other tables and merged ranges.
- `ExVEx.tables/1`, `ExVEx.tables/2`, `ExVEx.table/2` return
  `%ExVEx.Table{}` structs with the header, data, and totals ranges,
  column names, and style.
- `ExVEx.remove_table/2` deletes the table part, relationship, worksheet
  link, and content type; structured references to the table anywhere in
  the workbook become plain ranges.
- `ExVEx.rename_table/3` and `ExVEx.rename_table_column/4` update the
  part, the header cell, and every formula that names the table or
  column (cell formulas, conditional formatting, data validations,
  defined names, calculated-column and totals-row formulas).
- `ExVEx.resize_table/3`, `ExVEx.put_table_style/3`.
- `ExVEx.put_table_totals_row/3` and `ExVEx.remove_table_totals_row/2`
  manage the totals row, writing `SUBTOTAL` formulas, custom formulas,
  or labels into its cells.
- `ExVEx.table_rows/2`, `ExVEx.table_records/2`, and
  `ExVEx.append_table_rows/3` read and extend the data body; appended
  rows fill calculated columns and move the totals row down.
- Row/column shifts now keep table parts consistent: tables grow,
  shrink, move, or are removed; inserted columns get placeholder header
  cells; a shift that removes every data row leaves a header and one
  blank row.
- `ExVEx.Formula.Tokenizer` emits structured references
  (`Table1[Amount]`, `[@Qty]`, `T[[#Headers],[Col]]`) as a distinct
  token kind that shifts never rewrite.

### Fixed

- `insert_row/4`, `delete_row/4`, `insert_column/4`, and
  `delete_column/4` on one sheet no longer move cells, merged ranges, or
  other structure on every other sheet. Other sheets now have only their
  formulas rewritten, and are re-serialized only when a formula changed.
- Formula tokenizer: identifiers that resemble cell references
  (`LOG10(`, `Table1`, `My.A1`) are no longer rewritten as references
  on row/column shifts. Previously `=LOG10(A1)` became `=LOG11(A2)` and
  `=SUM(Table1[Amount])` became `=SUM(TABLE2[Amount])` after an insert.
- `ExVEx.Formula.Reference.parse/1` and `ExVEx.Utils.Coordinate.parse/1`
  enforce Excel's row (1,048,576) and column (XFD) limits.

### Changed

- `ExVEx.OOXML.Table` is a struct (`parse/1`, `serialize/1`, `shift/2`)
  rather than a binary-in/binary-out shifter. `ExVEx.OOXML.SheetSatellites`
  handles comments and drawings only; table parts are handled by
  `ExVEx.Workbook.TableParts`.
- Cell value encoding and decoding moved from `ExVEx` into
  `ExVEx.CellCodec`; `ExVEx.sheet_path/2` delegates to
  `ExVEx.Workbook.sheet_path/2`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- `ExVEx.clear_sheet_dimension/2` — drops the `<dimension>` element
  from a sheet so Excel recomputes the used range on next open. Use
  after bulk mutations where the cached extent no longer matches.

### Fixed

- `ExVEx.OOXML.SharedStrings.serialize/1` now XML-escapes shared-string
  text. Strings containing `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, or `'` were emitted as
  raw bytes through `Saxy.XML.element/3`, producing invalid XML that
  Excel rejected as "corrupt." Any workbook touched by ExVEx where a
  cell value contained one of those characters was affected on save.
  Re-saving an affected workbook with 0.2.0 produces a clean file.

### Changed (breaking)

- `ExVEx.Workbook.put_sheet_tree/3` now takes an
  `%ExVEx.OOXML.Worksheet.Editable{}` as its third argument instead of
  a raw `{"worksheet", attrs, children}` SimpleForm tuple, and
  `book.sheet_trees` likewise stores `Editable` structs. Callers
  reaching past `ExVEx.*` into `Workbook.put_sheet_tree/3` or
  `book.sheet_trees` directly will need to migrate. The public
  `ExVEx.*` API is unchanged.

### Added — structural row/column mutations (umya-spreadsheet parity)

- `ExVEx.insert_row/4`, `ExVEx.delete_row/4`, `ExVEx.insert_column/4`,
  `ExVEx.delete_column/4`. A shift on a sheet now cascades through every
  location that can carry a reference to a row or column:

  - Cell grid (rekeyed ETS entries; cells inside a deletion span are
    dropped).
  - Cell formulas (rewritten via `ExVEx.Formula.Shift`; references
    inside deleted rows/cols become `#REF!`).
  - Row dimension attributes (`<row r="…">`).
  - Merged ranges.
  - Workbook-level defined names.
  - Conditional formatting `sqref` + `<formula>` children
    (`ExVEx.OOXML.ConditionalFormatting`).
  - Data validations `sqref` + `<formula1>` / `<formula2>` children
    (`ExVEx.OOXML.DataValidations`).
  - AutoFilter ranges (`ExVEx.OOXML.AutoFilter`).
  - Comments (`xl/comments*.xml`) — each `<comment ref="…">` is shifted
    and comments inside a deletion span are dropped.
  - Tables (`xl/tables/table*.xml`) — the table ref plus any embedded
    `<autoFilter>` / `<sortState>`.
  - Drawings (`xl/drawings/drawing*.xml`) — `<xdr:from>` / `<xdr:to>`
    row and column anchors.

  Satellite parts are located through each worksheet's `.rels` file
  (`ExVEx.OOXML.SheetSatellites`) so the cascade reaches every linked
  document without the workbook having to model them in full.

### Changed (performance — second round)

Elixir bulk-write throughput now beats Python (openpyxl) on the
comparative benchmark and runs in ~1/4 of the previous time.

- **Map-backed editable sheet (`ExVEx.OOXML.Worksheet.Editable`).** The
  SimpleForm tree's nested lists are replaced at edit time with a
  `%{{row, col} => cell_tuple}` map. `put_cell` / `get_cell` /
  `merge_cells` / `unmerge_cells` now work in O(log N) instead of
  O(rows + cols) per call.
- **ETS-backed cell grid and shared-string table.** Cells live in an
  ETS `:set` table (O(1) ops). The shared-string table (`SharedStrings`)
  has moved from a tuple to two ETS tables (`by_index`, `by_string`)
  with O(1) intern. Read + write share state across workbook references
  derived from the same `open` / `new`, which matches how cells are
  shared — there is no "some-sharing-but-not-string-sharing" corner
  case.
- **`ExVEx.close/1`.** Releases the backing ETS tables. Optional in
  short-lived processes (BEAM cleans up on exit), recommended in
  long-running servers.

Benchmark (Apple M3 Max, 12-sheet template, 24,800 cells per create,
48,000 cells per edit):

|                          | before (list) | after (ETS) | speedup |
| ------------------------ | ------------: | ----------: | ------: |
| Elixir create            | 481 ms        | 145 ms      | 3.3×    |
| Elixir edit (rotations)  | 943 ms avg    | 245 ms avg  | 3.8×    |
| Python edit              | ~300 ms       | ~300 ms     | (ref.)  |

The API is unchanged. Shared-state is documented in the
`ExVEx.OOXML.Worksheet.Editable` and `ExVEx.OOXML.SharedStrings`
moduledocs — `{:ok, b2} = put_cell(b1, ...)` may leave `b1` observing
`b2`'s mutation. In practice this doesn't affect the common flow
(`open → mutate → save`); if you need a snapshot, save and re-open.

### Added (workbook creation)

ExVEx is now a complete xlsx library — it can create workbooks from scratch,
not just edit existing ones. No Python or Rust dependency needed for
template generation.

- `ExVEx.new/0` — returns a minimal blank workbook with a single empty
  sheet named `"Sheet1"`. No fixture file needed; the skeleton parts are
  embedded in the library.
- `ExVEx.add_sheet(book, name)` — appends a new empty sheet.
  `{:error, :duplicate_sheet_name}` if the name is already in use.
- `ExVEx.rename_sheet(book, old, new)` — changes a sheet's name in place.
  `{:error, :unknown_sheet}` or `{:error, :duplicate_sheet_name}` as
  appropriate. Same-name is a no-op.
- `ExVEx.remove_sheet(book, name)` — drops a sheet and its worksheet part,
  plus the matching Content Types Override and workbook relationship.
  `{:error, :last_sheet}` guards against producing an invalid
  zero-sheet workbook.

All four coordinate `workbook.xml`, `workbook.xml.rels`, and
`[Content_Types].xml` together on every change. A new
`OOXML.Workbook.serialize_into/2` rewrites the `<sheets>` section while
preserving surrounding elements at the SimpleForm level.

Example — build a multi-sheet template from zero:

    {:ok, book} = ExVEx.new()
    {:ok, book} = ExVEx.rename_sheet(book, "Sheet1", "Summary")
    {:ok, book} = ExVEx.add_sheet(book, "Data")
    {:ok, book} = ExVEx.add_sheet(book, "Formulas")
    {:ok, book} = ExVEx.put_cell(book, "Data", "A1", "alpha")
    {:ok, book} = ExVEx.put_cell(book, "Formulas", "A1", {:formula, "=SUM(Data!A1:A10)"})
    :ok = ExVEx.save(book, "template.xlsx")

### Changed (performance)

Bulk writes are now ~20× faster with ~60× less memory churn.

- **Sheet tree cache.** `%ExVEx.Workbook{}` now caches the parsed
  `Saxy.SimpleForm` tree for every worksheet on first access. Subsequent
  `get_cell`, `put_cell`, `merge_cells`, `unmerge_cells`, `merged_ranges`,
  `get_formula`, `get_style`, `cells`, and `each_cell` calls reuse the
  cached tree instead of re-parsing the XML. `save/2` re-serializes only
  dirty sheet trees once at flush time.
- **Shared-string interns are O(1).** `ExVEx.OOXML.SharedStrings` now
  stores strings in two maps (`by_index`, `by_string`) instead of a
  tuple. Interning a new string was O(N) per call (tuple copy); it is
  now O(1).

Benchmark: 500 `put_cell + save` dropped from 142 ms / 348 MB to 7 ms /
6 MB. 1000 unique string interns + save dropped from 761 ms / 1.8 GB to
36 ms / 16 MB. See `bench/results/README.md` for the full report and
instructions on reproducing.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-17

First release. Pre-alpha — API may evolve.

### Added

- `ExVEx.open/1` and `ExVEx.save/2` — byte-preserving round-trip on every
  part in the archive that the caller has not explicitly mutated, including
  `.xlsm` VBA binaries, custom XML, and unknown content types.
- `ExVEx.sheet_names/1` and `ExVEx.sheet_path/2` for sheet navigation.
- `ExVEx.get_cell/3` — reads strings (shared & inline), numbers, booleans,
  dates (as `Date`), date-times (as `NaiveDateTime`), formula results, and
  cell errors.
- `ExVEx.put_cell/4` — writes:
  - strings (deduplicated through the shared-string table when present; falls
    back to inline strings when the workbook has none)
  - numbers (integers and floats)
  - booleans
  - `nil` (clears the cell)
  - `{:formula, "..."}` and `{:formula, "...", cached_value}`
  - `Date` and `NaiveDateTime` (converted to Excel serial numbers; an xf
    with the matching date numFmtId is added to `xl/styles.xml` if one
    isn't already present)
- `ExVEx.get_formula/3` — reads the formula string from a formula cell.
- `ExVEx.get_style/3` — resolves a cell's style into a flat
  `%ExVEx.Style{}` with font, fill, border, alignment, and number-format
  sub-records dereferenced from the stylesheet.
- `ExVEx.cells/2` — returns every populated cell on a sheet as a
  `%{ref => value}` map.
- `ExVEx.each_cell/2` — streams every populated cell in row-major order.
- `ExVEx.merge_cells/3,4`, `ExVEx.unmerge_cells/3,4`,
  `ExVEx.merged_ranges/2` — merged-cell management with Excel-faithful
  defaults (clears non-anchor cells on merge; exact-match required on
  unmerge). Options: `:preserve_values` (`false` | `true`),
  `:on_overlap` (`:error` | `:replace` | `:allow`), `:on_missing`
  (`:error` | `:ignore`). Ranges are stored as
  `<mergeCells><mergeCell ref="A1:B2"/></mergeCells>` in the worksheet
  XML, inserted in the correct position in the schema's element order.
- OOXML parsers: `Packaging.ContentTypes`, `Packaging.Relationships`,
  `OOXML.Workbook`, `OOXML.Worksheet`, `OOXML.SharedStrings`, `OOXML.Styles`.
- Style model: `ExVEx.Style` + `Font`, `Fill`, `Border`, `Side`,
  `Alignment`, `Color`.
- Coordinate utilities: `ExVEx.Utils.Coordinate` — A1 ↔ `{row, col}`,
  Excel's bijective base-26 column labels.

### Formula freshness on save

When a workbook is mutated, ExVEx invalidates the calculation chain cache
so Excel recomputes formulas on open instead of showing stale `#N/A`
placeholders. On save of a dirty workbook:

- `xl/calcChain.xml` is dropped from the archive.
- Its entry is removed from `[Content_Types].xml` and
  `xl/_rels/workbook.xml.rels`.
- `<calcPr fullCalcOnLoad="1">` is set on `xl/workbook.xml`.

No-op saves (open → save without mutation) leave every part byte-identical.

### Coordinate addressing

Every cell-addressing function (`get_cell/3`, `put_cell/4`, `get_formula/3`,
`get_style/3`) accepts either A1-notation (`"B2"`) or a 1-indexed
`{row, col}` integer tuple (`{2, 2}`). Useful when porting from openpyxl
or iterating by numeric coordinates. `ExVEx.Utils.Coordinate.to_string/1`
is also public if you need to convert explicitly.

### Quality gates

- 125 ExUnit tests, all passing.
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`, `mix format --check-formatted`,
  `mix credo --strict` — all clean.
- GitHub Actions CI runs the above plus dialyzer on every push / PR.
- Output produced by `put_cell/4` + `save/2` is successfully read back by
  [umya-spreadsheet](https://crates.io/crates/umya-spreadsheet) (Rust) — a
  strong proxy for "Excel accepts this" without requiring Excel in CI.
